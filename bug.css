The following CSS code has an uncommon error that might not be immediately apparent:  .container {width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: space-between;}.item {width: 200px;}.item:last-of-type {margin-right: 0;} This code intends to space out several items within a container, but the last item might not be spaced correctly depending on the browser's rendering behavior. The problem occurs when the total width of the items exceeds the container's width. In this scenario, the 'space-between' distribution isn't predictable.
